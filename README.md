## About this repo

You might be reading this because you applied to a job to us or just because
you're curious, that's cool.

If you're an applicant, you might have limited time, deliver as much as you can
or want, the minimum amount of required work is:
- the [quiz](quiz.md)
- at least 1 part of the [projects](project.md)

If you're an applicant **you're required to provide an ETA for your delivery**.

Final delivery is open to preference ;)

## Contents

Three sections only:

- [Quiz](quiz.md): we want to know more about you, your style, your likes and dislikes.
- [Snippets](snippets.md): small chunks of code, or small programs to see what's your problem
solving style
- [Project](project.md): a 3 parts project to complete so you can show off all your skills.

## Rules

- **YOU MUST PROVIDE AN ETA**
- Assume error_reporting enabled and E_ALL flag set.
- Assume PHP5.5+, no upward limit. memory limit = 256M.
  - Any other PHP ini setting, assume default value.
- Assume a Linux environment with Nginx+PHP or PHP built-in web server.
- Assume we'll read your code, remember:
  - Clean code is a HUGE plus.
  - Documented code is a big plus, well documented is a HUGE plus.
- All code must work out of the box
  - if configuration is required, include default values and a README for it.

## Notes

- Its time for you to show off.
- Validation and sanitization are VERY important.
- If it says "open specs" it means you're free to choose.
- All code can fail, prepare yours to fail gracefully.
- You can use frameworks or base components, just keep in mind the size of it.
- You can use Composer packages, just describe your reasons to chose one or the other.
- You can use CDNs, google libraries, etc.
- Yes, final Web optimization is important but not required for this test.
